        and AngularJS front-end. This software helped Customer Support Engineers better understand and more
        efficiently respond to customer needs. Not only that, but it also greatly reduced the amount of
        time it took each week to assemble critical reports. While working on this project, I had the opportunity
        to get familiar with AngularJS, Javascript, C#, .NET, and SQL.`,

        by migrating a large section of existing UI code from Angular 1 to Angular 4, writing UI tests using Jasmine and Angular

        for dinner, or if someone is new to an area, they may not be aware of all the nearby food options. Users can
        simply say <i>Alexa, ask Random Restaurant for a place to eat</i>, and the app will give them a restaurant recommendation
        that is nearby and currently open.`,

        `The skill is hosted on AWS as a node.js lambda function. It works by collecting the user's address from the device that makes
        the request. It then passes that information to the Yelp public API, which returns a list of nearby and open restaurants.
        From that list, one restaurant is randomly chosen and suggested to the user. Users can also request a specific type of food or
        limit the price range of the suggested restaurant.`
