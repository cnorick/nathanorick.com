            `I worked for twelve consecutive months at the Johnson City, TN office. There, I developed data-analysis
            software that collects, persists, analyzes, and visualizes customer and employee contribution and
            interaction on the companyâ€™s community website. The application was written with a .NET/C# backend
            and AngularJS front-end. This software helped Customer Support Engineers better understand and more
            efficiently respond to customer needs. Not only that, but it also greatly reduced the amount of
            time it took each week to assemble critical reports. While working on this project, I had the opportunity
            to get familiar with AngularJS, Javascript, C#, .NET, and SQL.`,

            `I also worked for three months at the OSIsoft Headquarters in San Leandro, CA. There, I worked as a part
            of a larger team, developing and testing an Angular UI for customer-facing software. I contributed to this project
            by migrating a large section of existing UI code from Angular 1 to Angular 4, writing UI tests using Jasmine and Angular
            testing tools, and designing/writing new components for the UI.`
