          I am a
          <a href="http://www.eecs.utk.edu/">Computer Science</a> student at the
          <a href="http://www.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee, Knoxville</a> minoring in Math, graduating May 12th, 2018. At UT, I am an ambassador for the
          <a href="http://www.coop.utk.edu/">Engineering Professional Practice Office</a> where I counsel engineering students in their internship searches.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>I recently finished four terms as a software development intern at
          <a href="http://www.osisoft.com/">OSIsoft, LLC</a>. I worked three semesters in the Johnson City, TN office, and one semester at OSIsoft's HQ in San Leandro, CA. <!-- Check out what I worked on there below in the <a>projects</a> section -->
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>I love programming, and I'm really excited work in software development professionally after graduation! I can't wait to put my skills and knowledge to good use on projects that will change the world.</p>
