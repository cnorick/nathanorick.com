Squirrel Petting Simulator is a game I created for my computer graphics class. The shaders were required for the project, and were written using WebGL. The animation and the game mechanics I coded in just for fun. All of the 3D objects I borrowed from creators online.

Click below to play the game! The controls require a keyboard and mouse, and the game works best on Chrome.
