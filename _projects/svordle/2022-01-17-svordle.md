My wife and I got kind of addicted to playing [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). So much so, that playing once
a day wasn't quite scratching our itch. So I decided to make a clone of the game that could be played multiple times in a row.

For the last couple years before making this, I'd been hearing a lot about Svelte. Everyone who'd used it had told me it's
one of the best Javascript frameworks they'd worked with, so it seemed like this was the best time to give it a shot.

After putting this game together, I have to say I agree. The Svelte devs have done a fantastic job getting rid of the need for
any boilerplate code. I was able to hop right in and create some of the smallest, easiest-to-understand components I've ever
made in my career. I really hope to get to use it a lot more in the future.
