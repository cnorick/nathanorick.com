Are you or a friend getting married? Do you want a quick way to make a customizable website? This is the theme for you!

When I got married, I created a website to commemorate the occasion
as well as to provide information to my guests. Then not long after, I had a bunch of friends get married, who also wanted a site.
I made the same site three times until I finally realized my life would be a lot easier if I could just use the same structure, but with different content. Enter Jekyll Theme: Easy Wedding.

It's really easy to get started. The github README explains how to install and use the theme, then once you've done that, all that's left is to change the data in a handful of yaml files.
The best part is that if you set the theme as a dependency in a Gem file, you'll get free updates as the theme improves.
