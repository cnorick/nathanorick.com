I'm a Computer Science and Math graduate from the [University of Tennessee](https://utk.edu), currently working at [Capital One](https://www.capitalonecareers.com/). I love working with web technologies, and I have plenty of experience with Angular. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
